Democrats, 'historically branched off of the Democratic-Republicans with the focus on organized party leadership and a platform of individual liberty, allowing that liberty to transcend economic regulation for individuals and therefore often coming full circle into select individuals or organizations controlling the liberties of the masses, examples being the autonomous higher education system institutions or government housing projects; often historians give credit to the election of President Jackson for founding the Democratic Party, which is the oldest currently active political party and recently translated economic liberty into civil rights for underachieving demographics and empowerment of women in educated professions; also transcending platforms to support fair wages for workers over negotiation power of management, especially as it became decoupled with trade unions but maintained this political stance'
Democratic-Republicans, 'party formed out of the Anti-Administration party by President Thomas Jefferson gaining support by agrarian voters, however being focused mainly on the role of government to be establishing economic laws for citizens rather than seeking economic control of businesses (rather than being focused on limiting government intervention into agrarian lifestyles); formed originally as a secret society in Philadelphia in opposition to elitist separation of social classes through the financial system which is how they interpreted the Federalist Party, and became the only active political party throughout the country within a few years, electing President Jefferson to succeed the only Federalist President, President John Adams. They effectively eliminated the Federalist Party from Presidential politics and when they established a political platform evolved into the Whig Party'
Federalists, 'a coalition of bankers and businessmen that formed strong federal government fiscal policy and nationalistic implied powers; overtly aligned with Great Britain; based in New England and cities; and turned to the judicial branch of government to enforce laws to their financial agenda for thirty years after President John Adams; mainly platformed by U.S. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton and favored national unity for economic development as opposed to small government and agrarian living, with the tradeoff of centralized government control, in order to raise the ceiling of individual wealth possibilities for Americans among their international neighbors'
Unaffiliated, 'President George Washington was unaffiliated and led to his successor being the only President in the Federalist Party, President John Tyler was unaffiliated after the first five months of his one term (April-September 1841); in the case of President Washington being due to founding the office of the President as an extension of being the Commander in Chief of the Continental Army into the civil leadership of the country, and therefore in simple terms an army general is not a member of a political party; in the case of President Tyler being due to ascending to the Presidency as a Vice President from political uncertainty before it became a Constitutional amendment for the Vice President to be next in line, which led to splitting from the political boss Henry Clay as Speaker of the House and Whig rival to the Presidency'

Harding had a rival politician thrown in jail for being a member of the Socialist Party'
National Union Party, 'political party formed by Whigs to reelect President Abraham Lincoln and Vice President Andrew Johnson after the Civil War had divided the Whigs and before the Yankee Army formed into the Republican Party; President Andrew Johnson maintained this party label when becoming the President after the assassination of President Lincoln; focusing on policies to economically support the American people and denying legislative action taken to help former slaves participate in the economy or action to support other minorities; which led to the Republican Party being formed from the Yankee Army to loosely couple the American people with civil values in a political party, initially viewing military service as a way for the common man to join the economic plan; (as this was being written on September 23, 2019, 10:30pm (beginning 1 hour before) Australian eastern time Wikipedia updated the Presidential Party listing to show President Andrew Johnson's unaffiliated year as Democratic, althought the offical White House website states that President Andrew Johnson was not endorsed by the Democratic Party during his tenure since he failed to gain the Democratic ticket for the upcoming Presidential election even though he was beforehand and afterwards as a Senator)'
